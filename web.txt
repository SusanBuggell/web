**How does the internet work? What happens when you click on a link? **

The internet works by conducting some things up front, and some things behind the scenes.  
The internet is a networked collection of hardware and software.  Various pieces of hardware 
are routers, switches and modems.  Routers connect your computer either via WiFi or cable 
connection to the internet.  The data then goes from a modem to your Routing tables map 
out a path for data to get from starting point to ending point, allowing for alternate routes 
if something is taking too long somewhere.

When you click on a link, lots of things might happen.  On a base level, when one clicks on a 
link, a request is being made from the Front-End/Client-Side for something, as a .get request.  
On the other end of this equation, the Back-End/Server-Side responds to this request by either 
returning what is expected, or if configured to do so, sending an error response saying what 
went wrong.   Whether you're requesting to download a file, going to a website, reading your 
favorite web manga, logging in to your gMail, checking your bank balance before ordering something 
from Amazon, watching cat videos or rewatching "Llamas with Hats‚Äù on youTube, for the four million, 
nine hundred forty thousand, and nineteenth time to take a coding break before your head explodes, 
all these things you may or may not have been aware of were happening all along. Just like in Disney's 
The Sword in the Stone, that's what makes the world go round.
